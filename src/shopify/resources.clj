    (get-list :products {:limit 2} auth)

If you only provide one map, it's assumed to be the params/attributes, so you'll need to provide authentication with `with-opts`:

    (with-opts auth
      (get-list :products {:limit 2}))

If you don't give a keyword as the first argument, the function will look for the resource type under a `:shopify.resources/type` key in the params/attributes map. This key is present in all resource attribute maps returned by the library, so you can chain together reading and writing operations conveniently like so:

    (with-opts auth
      (-> (get-one :page {:id 99})
          (update-in [:title]
